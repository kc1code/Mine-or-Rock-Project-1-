# Rock vs. Mine Classification using SONAR Data ðŸª¨

## Overview
This project is a machine learning system that predicts whether an object is a **Rock** or a **Mine** based on SONAR data. The system uses a **Logistic Regression Model** for classification.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is **SONAR Data**, where:
  - **M** represents "Mine"
  - **R** represents "Rock"
- The dataset contains numerical features extracted from sonar signals.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-mine-classifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rock-mine-classifier
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run the cells sequentially.

## Project Workflow
1. **Import Dependencies**
   - Load necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn)
2. **Load Dataset**
   - Read SONAR dataset using Pandas
   - Perform initial exploration (shape, description, value counts)
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Separate features (X) and target variable (Y)
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets
4. **Train the Model**
   - Apply Logistic Regression
   - Train the model using training data
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculate accuracy on training and testing datasets
   - Display performance metrics
6. **Making Predictions**
   - Provide new input data
   - Predict if the object is a Rock or a Mine

## Model Performance
- The accuracy of the model on training and test data is displayed in the notebook.
- Additional evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score can be added for better insights.

## Example Prediction
```python
input_data = (0.0203, 0.0121, 0.0380, ..., 0.0016)  # Example SONAR signal values
prediction = model.predict([input_data])
if prediction[0] == 'R':
    print("The object is a Rock")
else:
    print("The object is a Mine")
```

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Feature Scaling** using `StandardScaler`
- Tune hyperparameters for better performance
- Try other classifiers like **SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks**
